In this Challenge, we assume the role of a quantitative analyst for a FinTech investing platform. This platform aims to offer clients a one-stop online investment solution for their retirement portfolios thatâ€™s both inexpensive and high quality. (Think about Wealthfront (Connexions vers un site externe.) or Betterment (Connexions vers un site externe.)). To keep the costs low, the firm uses algorithms to build each client's portfolio. The algorithms choose from various investment styles and options.
We will evaluate four new investment options for inclusion in the client portfolios. Legendary fund and hedge-fund managers run all four selections. We will  determine the fund with the most investment potential based on key risk-management metrics: the daily returns, standard deviations, Sharpe ratios, and betas.
The result from this analysis will indicate the best choice of fund to add as a potrtfolio for diversification.
